## Status

**This project is not actively maintained.**

Due to my workload and limited capacities for Open-Source projects, I can't spend as much time on maintenance and the community as I wish I could.

## How to contribute

### Bugs only

Besides bug fixes, any other kind of created issue or Pull Request might be ignored or closed without further notice.

### Fork

I suggest creating a fork under your profile to adjust to your needs and build a thriving community there.
