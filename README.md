## How to use

Before you download and test this, make sure to get familiar with the notes described below.

**Use at your own risk and responsibility!**

### Important considerations

This software is intended for use on private computers for creative purposes and gaming only.

- **Do not** start when other softwares are still open on your PC (e.g. a browser with open tabs, email tools, any software you might be using that stores and handles important data)
- **Only** use if you know how to switch between Windows and close the app, in case you loose control. Certain settings make it nearly impossible to click accurately and you must use your keyboard instead.
- Make sure to know the keyboard use for this tool and the software you are going to use it with (e.g. your drawing programs or a game). You might need to switch from your current software to the tool and end it.
- It is intended for hardware **Mouses** only. Any other hdardware – like  controllers – might not work properly or lead to unknown, potentially unstable behaviour.

### Preparations

1. Start the desired software to use this tool with
   - If you need, prepare anything beforehand (e.g. setting up custom brushes to draw with)
2. Start this tool (but don't activate it yet)

**Stay with the default settings for a while.** These are controllable and will only cause minimal distortion for your mouse cursor.
